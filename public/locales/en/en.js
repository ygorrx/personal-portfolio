    ", and I’m from Brasil. I have a Bachelor degree in Digital Systems and Media by the Federal University of Ceara. Always have been in love with technology and t's all possibilities. I've always had a fascination with the arts, and I've always wanted to know how things worked, how everything I saw on the internet, on TV and in publications was made. That's how I came to appreciate design. With the introduction of new technology, my interest in the web world grew with time. Currently, I'm seeking for a career transition. Despite the fact that I graduated with a degree in software development, I chose to continue my professional career as a Creative Designer, working in domains such as marketing, user interface and user experience. Now that I'm back in the development world, I see no better way to do it than to apply the skills I've gained in the field with which I'm most familiar,",
